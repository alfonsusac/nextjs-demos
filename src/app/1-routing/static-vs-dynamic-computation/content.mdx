- Routes in Next.js are either computed **statically** or **dynamically**.
- <span className="bg-zinc-600/40">**Statically Computed Routes**</span> is computed at <span className="bg-blue-600/40">build-time</span> while,\
  <span className="bg-zinc-600/40">**Dynamically Computed Routes**</span> is computed at <span className="bg-blue-600/40">request-time</span>
- Statically computed routes are what is commonly referred as **static routes** and is associated with **(SSG) Static Site Generation**
- The staticity of a route is determined as a whole route as opposed to individual route segments.
  
  Meaning that in a single route, as of now, it is impossible to mix components that are rendered at build time and request time.


## Dynamic Routes vs Dynamically Computed Routes

> "Is my route Dynamic or Static?"

In Next.js the use of the dynamic keyword can have two context/meaning. It is important to distinghuish the difference between those two as it gets mixed up frequently when explaining this concept.

- <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Dynamic Routes</span> refers to the ability for developer to declare a variable in their route\
  i.e `/shop/[itemID]` where `itemID` is a placeholder for a variable.

- <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Dynamically Computed Routes</span> refers to the ability for a route to be computed at request-time. This is denoted with the lambda (`λ`) symbol in the list of routes shown in the build log 

Developers can check the staticity of all of the routes by looking at the Next.js build logs. (i.e at `npx next build`)



## Things that Affect Precomputation of a Route

> "Why is my route dynamic?"

It is important to know that all routes are <span className="bg-blue-600/40">statically computed by default</span> However, the usage of following things will change a static route into a dynamically computed route:

1. <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Dynamic routes</span> i.e. `/articles/[articleID]`

2. <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Dynamic functions</span> i.e. `cookies()`, `headers()`

3. <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Segment route configs</span> i.e. `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`


The following things will change a dynamically computed route into a static route: 

1. The use of `generateStaticParams()` in dynamic routes.

2. The use of `export const dynamic = 'force-static';`

## Quick Examples

- ○ `/about` -> static
- ○ `/articles` -> static
- **λ** `/dashboard` that uses `headers()` to check user auth -> dynamic
- **λ** `/articles/[articleID]` -> dynamic
- ○ `/articles/[articleID]` but uses `generateStaticParams()` -> static
- ○ `/articles/[articleID]` but `dynamic = 'force-static'` -> static
