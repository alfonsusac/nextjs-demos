## Introduction

Generally, routes in Next.js are computed either <Blue>statically</Blue> or <Purple>dynamically</Purple>. They differ in when the routes are computed and how the routes are cached.

- <B>Statically Computed</B> routes are routes that are computed <Blue>only once</Blue> and <Blue>stay in the build cache</Blue> either indefinetly or for a period of time.




- While <B>Dynamically Computed</B> routes are routes that are computed at <Purple>request time</Purple> for each user, and is <Purple>cached in the user's browser</Purple>.


- Both API routes and Pages routes can be dynamically or statically computed.


- The staticity of a route is <b>determined on the whole route</b> and not to individual route segments.
  
  Meaning that in a single route, as of now, it is impossible to mix components that are rendered at build time and request time.


## Static Generation

Generation of static routes can happen either at <b>built-time</b> or at <b>request-time</b>. 

- Static Routes that are generated at <Blue>build-time</Blue> is commonly referred as **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. Those routes are cached indefinetly until the next time the project is re-built.

- Static routes that are generated at request-time is when the information to build that route has not yet existed or has been invalidated. This is what is referred as **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**.

Request-time static routes can happens by two things:

- **generateStaticParams**: Generated static params does not cover new params. (See )
- The route has been invalidated by either: running out revalidation time or on-demand invalidation



 and they can also be revalidated after a define period of time. This is what is referred as **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**


## Dynamic Routes vs Dynamically Computed Routes

> "Is my route Dynamic or Static?"

In Next.js the use of the dynamic keyword can have two context/meaning. It is important to distinghuish the difference between those two as it gets mixed up frequently when explaining this concept.

- <B>Dynamic Routes</B> refers to the ability for developer to declare a variable in their route\
  i.e `/shop/[itemID]` where `itemID` is a placeholder for a variable.

- <B>Dynamically Computed Routes</B> refers to the ability for a route to be computed at request-time. This is denoted with the lambda (`λ`) symbol in the list of routes shown in the build log 

Developers can check the staticity of all of the routes by looking at the Next.js build logs. (i.e at `npx next build`)



## Things that Affect Precomputation of a Route

> "Why is my route dynamic?"

It is important to know that all routes are <span className="bg-blue-600/40">statically computed by default</span> However, the usage of following things will change a static route into a dynamically computed route:

1. <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Dynamic routes</span> i.e. `/articles/[articleID]`

2. <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Dynamic functions</span> i.e. `cookies()`, `headers()`

3. <span className="bg-blue-600/40">Segment route configs</span> i.e. `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`


The following things will change a dynamically computed route into a static route: 

1. The use of `generateStaticParams()` in dynamic routes.

2. The use of `export const dynamic = 'force-static';`

## Quick Examples

- ○ `/about` -> static
- ○ `/articles` -> static
- **λ** `/dashboard` that uses `headers()` to check user auth -> dynamic
- **λ** `/articles/[articleID]` -> dynamic
- ○ `/articles/[articleID]` but uses `generateStaticParams()` -> static
- ○ `/articles/[articleID]` but `dynamic = 'force-static'` -> static
