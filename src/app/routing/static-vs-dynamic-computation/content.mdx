## Introduction

Generally, routes in Next.js are computed either <Blue>statically</Blue> or <Purple>dynamically</Purple>. They differ in when the routes are computed and how the routes are cached.

- <B>Statically Computed</B> routes are routes that are computed <Blue>only once</Blue> and <Blue>stay in the build cache</Blue> either indefinetly or for a period of time.




- While <B>Dynamically Computed</B> routes are routes that are computed at <Purple>request time</Purple> for each user, and is <Purple>cached in the user's browser</Purple>.


- Both API routes and Pages routes can be dynamically or statically computed.


- The staticity of a route is <b>determined on the whole route</b> and not to individual route segments.
  
  Meaning that in a single route, as of now, it is impossible to mix components that are rendered at build time and request time.

## Static Generation

Static routes are statically computed routes. Generation of static routes can happen either at <b>built-time</b> or at <b>request-time</b>. 

- Static Routes that are generated at <Blue>build-time</Blue> is commonly referred as **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. Those routes are cached indefinetly until the next time the project is re-built. 

  In build log, it is represented as ○ or ●

  <CodeSnippet filepath="Build Log">
  ```txt
  ├ ○ /dogs               1.36 kB        78.9 kB
  ├ ● /dogs/[dogID]       1.01 kB        89.7 kB
  ├   ├ /dogs/Labrador
  ├   └ /dogs/Pomeranian
  ```
  </CodeSnippet>

  API Handlers can also be evaluated statically if they are GET and don't use the request object ([Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers#static-route-handlers))

- Some Static routes are generated at <Purple>request-time</Purple> because the information to build that route has not yet existed or has been invalidated. This is what is referred as **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**.

Request-time generation can happens by two things:

- **generateStaticParams**: Generated static params does not cover new params. (See [Dogs Example](/routing/static-vs-dynamic-computation/dogs/Retriever)). This can be disabled by adding `dynamicParams = false`
- **Revalidation**: The route has been invalidated by either: running out revalidation time or on-demand invalidation

## Dynamic Routes vs Dynamically Computed Routes

> "Is my route Dynamic or Static?"

In Next.js the use of the dynamic keyword can have two context/meaning. It is important to distinghuish the difference between those two as it gets mixed up frequently when explaining this concept.

- <B>Dynamic Routes</B> refers to the ability for developer to declare a variable in their route.\
  i.e `/shop/[itemID]` where `itemID` is a placeholder for a variable.

- <B>Dynamically Computed Routes</B> refers to the ability for a route to be computed at <Purple>request-time</Purple>. This is denoted with the lambda (`λ`) symbol in the list of routes shown in the build log 

- Dynamic Routes are **by default dynamically computed**. However, one can Generate static params to predefine the static path that the dynamic route can process, making it Statically Computed Routes.

  One can handle the behavior if the accessed params are outside of the generated params by using `dynamicParams`. If set to `true`, the server will statically build new route at request time, allowing ISR. If set to `false`, the user will be redirected to a 404 page.



Developers can check the staticity of all of the routes by looking at the Next.js build logs. (i.e at `npx next build`)

## Things that Affect Staticity of a Route

> "Why is my route dynamic?"

All routes are <B>statically computed by default</B> However, the usage of following things will change a static route into a dynamically computed route:

1. <B>Dynamic Routes</B> i.e. `/articles/[articleID]`
2. <B>Dynamic Functions</B> i.e. `cookies()`, `headers()` and `searchParams` either from the hook or from the props
3. <B>Route Segment Configs</B> i.e. `dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`'
4. <B>Using Request Object</B> in API handlers


The following things will change a dynamically computed route into a static route: 

1. The use of `generateStaticParams()` in dynamic routes.
2. The use of `dynamic = 'force-static';`



---



## Quick Examples

- ○ `/about` -> SSG
- ○ `/articles` -> SSG
- **λ** `/dashboard` that uses `headers()` to check user auth -> dynamic
- **λ** `/articles/[articleID]` -> dynamic
- ○ `/articles/[articleID]` but `dynamic = 'force-static'` -> ISR
- ● `/articles/[articleID]` but uses `generateStaticParams()` is ISR because ungenerated Params are still statically generated at request time
- ● `/articles/[articleID]` but uses `generateStaticParams()` and `dynamicParams = false` is static because ungenerated params forces 404
